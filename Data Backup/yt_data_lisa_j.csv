0YwYJVoh1S0,The Ultimate On-the-Go Makeup Kit!,"Hi friends! I'm so excited to share my brand new Trish McEvoy Makeup Planner with you.
With all the traveling I’ve been doing lately—and constantly doing my makeup at the office or in the studio—I realized I needed a better system. I was tired of packing and repacking my makeup bags over and over again. So I finally decided to invest in a planner that has everything I need for a full face in one compact, organized kit.

Whether you’re a fellow traveler, a busy professional, or just someone who loves a well-organized makeup bag, I think you’ll really enjoy this!

Come with me to the salon! ✂️✨ @beautylovegrace worked her magic and gave me the perfect long bob with interior texture. I always do balayage highlights and go for a light beige champagne blonde. We added the Mirror Rinse Glass Hair Treatment from @OribeHairCare  for that extra shine. She styled it using Featherbalm Weightless Styler, Royal Blowout Heat Styling Spray, and Après Beach Wave and Shine Spray—and I’m kinda loving the short hair life! What do you think… should I keep it this length?

mh4mfML-S_0,Worth the Hype?! Rom&nd Lip Balm First Impressions,"Rom&nd melting balm: https://go.shopmy.us/p-12168043

Everyone’s loving these! Here’s my first impression of the rom&nd Glasting Melting Balm—let’s see if it’s worth the hype!
These balms claim to deliver vivid color with a hydrating, non-drying formula packed with plant-based oils. They promise a smooth, watery glow without feeling heavy.
After testing the shades:
✨ Pros: Affordable ($8.90), vegan, lightweight, and great for a natural look.
✨ Cons: Very light pigmentation—almost no color payoff.
Overall, it’s a great choice for a no-makeup makeup look. If you love sheer, glowy balms that feel ultra-comfy, this might be for you!
Let me know what you think in the comments.

0U9xHudwyHU,Ilia Hydrating Lipstick and Liner Combo Review.,"This is both a lipstick and a liner in one!
I just received these and wanted to share a first impression because they sound so interesting. 

These are the ILIA Lip Sketch Hydrating Crayons—a jumbo-sized lipstick and liner combo with a soft-matte finish. 
They’re long-lasting and claim to boost hydration over time for fuller, more defined lips.

Let’s try them out!
✨ Shade Pampas: Such a pretty color! It feels creamy, matte, and super pigmented—love it.
✨ Shade Banquette: I’m obsessed with how moisturizing it feels while still being matte.

I just added a gloss, and these look absolutely stunning! Such a quick and easy look that keeps your lips hydrated. 💕

✨Summary and Notes from Video✨

Powder Foundation: 
Designed to offer full coverage 
Can achieve lighter coverage but using a fluffy brush
Does not require a setting powder 
Best applied when skin has been properly prepped so the powder adheres to skin and creates a more natural finish. 

Setting Powders:
Designed to set & lock in liquid or cream foundations and concealers
Best applied with a brush by pressing into skin rather than sweeping
Loose translucent options are going to be the lightest weight options
You can choose a shade to alter your foundation or to subtly highlight 

Finishing Powders:
Designed to give a filter effect to skin (blur pores, radiant finish)
Best applied all over the face as a last step to makeup
Comes in matte or glowy finishes 
Best Applied with a fluffy brush (BK 104)

CjF96YHCrqI,10 Years on YouTube! What a Journey! #bkbeauty #lisajmakeup,"The last 10 years have been a journey in so many ways. I look back at 31 year old Lisa and have so much compassion for her. I had no idea the growth the next 10 years would bring. I was a new mom when I started my YouTube channel. For me it was an outlet to continue my passion for makeup artistry as I was stepping away from working as a makeup artist. I had zero expectations it would become more than a fun hobby. Through YouTube I have made so many friendships with women that inspire me in so many ways to dream BIG, and I’ve made real friendships with viewers that remind me the real reward is hearing feedback of how my videos help women feel more confident or find fun in the daily routine of applying their makeup. And it gave me the platform to launch @thebkbeauty which still feels like a dream. @youtube changed my life and I am so grateful I started this channel and stuck with it. Thank you for being part of this journey with me! Xoxo 🙏🏼

O4VxaTE9nzs,Color Correcting 101,"Color correcting is a great tip to get better coverage under the eyes and reduce the amount of concealer you need to use. Apply it before applying concealer, or mix in with your concealer if using a liquid formula. A peach tone is best to neutralize dark circles, then go in with a lighter concealer to add brightness.

g_9jz1zXTjw,This $16 Foundation BLEW ME AWAY! Full face of Affordable Makeup!,"Hi Friends, hope you enjoy this video! I really loved how this makeup came together and can't say enough about this foundation, concealer and powder combo! Really beautiful and very natural looking. If you prefer a more satin finish, skip the powder or be very conservative  when you apply. It does give a matte look, but it's poreless and very airbrushed.

HapMNGkfyEo,Best Affordable Makeup for GLOWY SKIN!,"Hi Friends, hope you enjoy this video! Love a good drugstore foundation routine and this one is perfect for the season! If your skin is feeling drier as the temperatures drop, adding products to give a flow will give more life and hydration to the skin. I like to lean towards more cream, liquid products when possible, and limit the use of powder products as they can make your makeup and skin look drier.

TGCplmzftMA,"""CAKEY FOUNDATION"" and How To Fix It!","Hi Friends, hope you enjoy this video! These are some of the top reasons your foundation is cakey and I share tips are how to fix them! As we age, foundation and makeup looks different on the skin so it is important to know how to prepare the skin for makeup and how to apply makeup so that we don't emphasize fine lines, wrinkles and texture in the skin. These are some of the most common reasons why your foundation looks heavy. I hope you find this video helpful, if you do please leave one thing you took away from this video in the comment section below!

0e9yMTcX2NI,Radiant summer makeup routine!✨,"I am loving how healthy and fresh my skin looks with the new @bobbibrown Vitamin Enriched Skin Tint SPF 15 and the Vitamin Enriched Pressed Powder. The tint gives just enough coverage while leaving the skin looking natural and radiant. The powder locks in makeup, smooths, and blurs texture without drying out my skin thanks to vitamin B5. These products are natural makeup summer staples! @Sephora #BobbiBrown #Sephora #Ad

I wanted to share a few products that I have been enjoying to support wellbeing and my self care routine.

I tried a lot of new makeup last month. Have you tried the new drugstore concealer from Cover Girl? It is a beautiful affordable drugstore concealer for dry or textured, mature skin. It is lightweight and looks very natural. I love it!

In today's video I am sharing my current top 5 mascaras. I love long, thick looking lashes. Since. my natural lashes aren't very long or thick, I need a good mascara that can deliver lots of lenght and volume without look clumpy. 

I added 2 mascaras in here that are more lengthening mascaras for those that like very long separated lashes. 

What are your top favorite mascaras?

pPpGJkD-6WI,BK Beauty Mothers Day Sale!,"SHOPS SALE: https://shrsl.com/3hy0x
Hi Friend! As Mother's Day approaches, I wanted to share a little bit about how being a mother influenced BK Beauty and our mission... 

As a beauty influencer and mom of two girls, I was starting to struggle with the ideas I was teaching them around beauty. I wanted to teach them that beauty comes from a place much deeper than what we see on the outside. 

""BK"" started with my two girls Brooklyn and Kate...

And the message I wanted to teach them about beauty is ""Beauty is Kindness""—kindness to others, but also kindness to ourselves.
In celebration of Mother's Day, we are having a sale where you can enjoy 20-35% OFF sitewide starting now through Sunday, May 8th.

SHOPS SALE: https://shrsl.com/3hy0x

So pickup something special for yourself or a special mom in your life. Sending you light and love... Happy Mother's Day!!

With love and gratitude, 💜

cFOkU7d9GII,NEW CONCEALER SHOWDOWN! KVD Beauty Good Apple Concealer vs LYS Triple Fix Brightening Concealer,"Hi Friends, hope you enjoy this video! Have you tried either of these concealers? Did you catch my recent video https://youtu.be/7tow8NVtUoM 5 Game Changing Eyeliner Hacks for Small and Hooded Eyes (SUPER Easy and looks INCREDIBLE!) 

I filmed this video a few weeks ago and have been continuing to use the LYS concealer. In fact I packed it on vacation because it's very light weight. I am always on the hunt for a good holy grail concealer that gives great coverage but looks natural and light under the eyes.

7tow8NVtUoM,5 Game Changing Eyeliner Hacks for Small and Hooded Eyes (SUPER Easy and looks INCREDIBLE!),"Hi Friends, hope you enjoy this video! If you like these kinds of videos talking about makeup hacks for small or hooded eyes you should check out this video: https://youtu.be/fk0kzbHvfzE  The BEST Makeup Artist Hacks for Naturally Looking Bigger and Brighter Eyes. 

In this video I share some of my favorite makeup artist tricks for lining small or hooded eyes. Eye liner can be easy to go wrong when you are working on smaller eyelids or eyes that have a hooded lid because the eyeliner can be applied in the wrong manner, or too thick.

fk0kzbHvfzE,The BEST Makeup Artist Hacks for Naturally Looking Bigger and Brighter Eyes,"Hi Friends, hope you enjoy this video! If you like these kinds of videos you should watch this one https://youtu.be/qRqmSPEFM9A Makeup Artist Secrets to Extreme Long Wear Makeup (+12 Hours!) How to set makeup to last ALL Day! In this video I share my tips for how to make your eyes look bigger with makeup but naturally. So these tricks are for when you don't want to look like you have a lot of makeup on, but you want to look your best. You can also use these tricks as building blocks to a more dramatic look, just be careful not to go over your work with too much heavy, dark matte shades in the wrong placement. 

These makeup tips and makeup hacks will make your eyes look bigger, brighter and more lifted.

cp8_uRYmuhs,Should you get eyelash extensions? Everything you need to know BEFORE getting lash extensions,"Hi Friends, hope you enjoy this video! Sharing everything you need to know about lash extensions. I have had lash extensions for about 12 years off and on, and I wanted to answer all your questions about lash extensions. I actually removed my lashes right after filming this video. For now I plan to give my lashes a nice long break but I may decide to get them back on in the future. 

Have you had lash extensions? What would you add to this video? Let us know!

jUHTeWxQWKA,7 Morning Habits That Will Dramatically Improve Your Life,"Hi Friends, hope you enjoy this video! Peloton username LisaJatx. This has been my morning routine for about a year and half and it really has made such an improvement in my life. Having time before anyone else wakes is so transformative. I use to start my days waking up and going right into a state of low level anxiety racing to get everything done that needed to get done because the clock was ticking... with this extra time, I'm able to have time to myself in a quiet home to be with my thoughts and without feeling like I am running out of time. 

What is your morning routine like?

In today's video I am finally sharing my first impressions on the Natasha Denona Face palette. I was so excited to try this palette, and perhaps that is why I was a little let down. I am a huge fan of Natasha Denona's eyeshadow formulas, and I have found them to be some of the best out there. This palette just let me down a little. I know I may be the minority opinion here, and it's possible I will play with this palette some more and find I do like it.

R3O1wKAhQHc,BK Beauty Lippie Launch! How I Pair Liners and Lipsticks 💄,"💋LAUNCHING TODAY! 💋

Hey friends! So excited and proud to share our FIRST Lip product launch! I hope you love this collection as much as I do! The formulas are hydrating, and weightless and they give the softest satin/matte finish. Think of how your lips feel when you apply matte lipstick over a lip conditioner. I can't wait to hear what you think when you try them. 

Always grateful for your support xoxo Lisa

I live in Texas and have combo skin so it is so important to me that my makeup stays in place all day without needing a lot of touch ups. I am also 38 years old so I'm looking for products that don't look heavy, or show texture on the skin. Hope you enjoy this video!

Hi Friends, Hope you enjoy this video! Do you like the more personal chit chat? I just had to get it off my chest, and hopefully it helps someone who might be going through something similar. My favorite quote I remind myself is ""Don't let the opinions of those that don't matter, matter the most"". I love this because its a great reminder that when people spread hate and negativity your way, they truly aren't worthy of a response or reaction. My best friend says, send them love because they are clearly in need of it. No one that is happy, joyful and has peace in their life spreads such nasty hate. truth! 

Anyhow.... thank you Mileva for being a big light in my week this week! xoxo Lisa

Hi Friends, Hope you enjoy this video! I have really been loving that NARS tinted moisturizer! Have you tried it yet? I have a video coming soon using it with the Dior Face & Body. That combo has become a new favorite! Natural looking, and long wearing when you combine the two. So excited for you to see that one later this week. 

What are some new recent faves you have discovered?

HACKS!
#1 Highlighting the face with concealer! Try Tarte’s Ultra Creamy Concealer to highlight the face where natural light touches.
#2  Mix your concealer and tinted sunscreen/moisturizer to create the perfect glow.
#3 Concealer as an eye primer! Try Tarte’s Ultra Creamy Concealer for dryer skin or Tarte’s Shape Tape for oilier skin.
#4 Highlight the brow bone! Use a concealer that is a little lighter and brighter than your skin tone to really brighten the eyes.
#5 Cleaning up the eye! After applying your makeup, clean up around the eye area. Apply concealer under the outer corner of your eyes and blend upwards. Try Tarte’s blending sponge for easy blending.
#6 Lips! Trace your lips with a concealer lighter and brighter than your skin tone.

Hi Friends! Happy Sunday! Hope you had a great week! Sharing this look I love using the new Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter Luxury Eye Palette. This formula is really beautiful! All shimmers but very soft and sheer. This palette would look beautiful on mature or textured eyelids. Also sharing the new NARS Claudette collection of lipsticks. 2 formulas a soft sheer matte lipstick that is really unique and innovative and also in their Audacious lipstick formula which is highly pigmented and creamy.

Michele creates tons of videos focused on Luxury Beauty reviews, hauls and new releases. She is the channel to watch before you purchase anything luxury. She uploads severals videos per week and has a thriving makeup loving community. 

🌟Chelsea Glamgirl Chelsea https://www.youtube.com/c/GlamGirlChelsea
Chelsea's channel is all things beauty. She also focuses on hot new product releases and does tutorials where she shows you 2 different looks with one palette. She also has a series she does with Kelsee Briana Jai and Alicia Kinkysweat called Behind the Beauty where they interview brand owners, celebrity makeup artists, and other prominent figures in the Beauty Industry. Its such a great series! 

Friends, I am so excited to share the True Beauty Palette with you! For our first eyeshadow palette, I wanted to create a neutral everyday palette that you could wear every shade. 

The palette has 6 matte shades, and 6 shimmer shades. The shimmers are a soft satin shimmer, for a beautiful subtle sheen on the skin. Beautiful on all skin tones and skin textures. 

The pop of color in the palette is KATE a gorgeous shimmer purple with pink shift. It can be worn alone on the lid, lower lash line or layered over any of the shades in the middle row to create the softest subtle shift of purple to the look. 

I hope you love the palette as much as I do! Always filled with love and gratitude xoxo Lisa

Hi Friends! Happy Thursday! Thank you for sending me video suggestions. I loved this one. I have always believed Primers worked but it was interesting to do a half face test like this. Obviously the results would vary depending on the primer, setting spray and foundation you use but I wanted to use products I already like so I can see if they may any difference when used together. 

What are your favorite primers and setting sprays?

Hi Friends! Hope you had a great week! This last week the girls had a break from school so we went camping the first weekend and spent the last half of the week at the beach! It was such a great week, and we had some great quality family time. I had hoped to get up my normal 3 videos this week but it didn't happen. Should be back to a schedule this next week though. xoxo Lisa

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. I get asked often which BK Beauty brushes are good for hooded eyes, so I thought this video would be helpful. I also wanted to explain why these brushes are good for hooded or smaller eyes so if you don't have these brushes, you can look at the brushes you already own and determine which are best. Hope it helps! xoxo Lisa

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. What are thoughts on these mistakes? Agree or disagree? Love to hear what you think below! What are your Makeup No Nos?! 

Please note some of the products I use in the video during the ""Mistakes"" Footage, are products I do like and use. But it's all in how you pair them with other products that I wanted to illustrate. For example I use the Supergoop Matte Primer with the Bare Minerals Foundation. I like both products but together they are too mattifying for the skin for me. I would opt to use a more hydrating primer for that particular foundation or skip on altogether. Hope that makes sense.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. Thank you to Verishop for sponsoring this video! I was able to pick items from their website in either category, and I chose cooking because it's something I've really gotten into since Quarantine started. I've really enjoyed trying new plant based recipes and I have found having quality cookware not only makes the food taste better, but it makes the process more fun. :)

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. What products are you loving this month? My biggest focus this month has been health. I have been spending a lot time cooking and making new delicious vegan soups and recipes and trying to learn as much as I can about nutrition and using food to heal the body. I find it so fascinating!

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. Just wanted to share some products I haven't had a chance to share lately. I am filming my Monthly Favorites video today and will have it up next week. I hope everyone is healthy and finding some positives during this crazy time we are all in right now. For me, its all the quality time with the kids and stepping back from overpacked schedules.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video! February was a busy month! I traveled to LA twice, once with Paul for a work trade show, and then at the end of the month with 2 friends for the Create and Cultivate conference. We had SO much fun! I got to hear Jessica Simpson speak about her new book Open Book, which I read and loved. And I got to see 2 YouTubers I love speak on panels, Adrienne Bailon and MonicaStyleMuse. I ran into Monica in the courtyard after her panel and introduced myself and she was SO incredibly sweet! She said BK Beauty brushes are her favorite so that was a HUGE highlight for me!

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video! I've slowly been building my Charlotte Tilbury Collection over the last year. I have to say its is probably my favorite brand currently. I have not tried a product I have not liked aside from the Airbrush Flawless Foundation which I found to be too heavy for me. its a beautiful line, with products that really perform for me without looking heavy or being hard to blend out.

Hi Friends! Hope you enjoy this video! Pretty simple hair routine for the days my hair is on its last day before I have to wash it. The Dyson Airwrap really makes it easy. Another more affordable alternative is the Revlon Dryer (I did a video on how I use that one with wet hair). The big difference is the Dyson uses less heat so its much better for your hair's health. I do love the Revlon for a quick easy style, but I wouldn't recommend using it daily because of how hot it gets.

Hi Friends! What are you loving this month?! I can't believe the year is almost over! 
I hope you are enjoying this time of year, it's my favorite time of year but it can also bring stress and a feeling of being overwhelmed. I'm trying to manage that with keeping lists and scheduling things that need to get done over the week. I feel so much more at ease if I know a task has an assigned day to be worked on. I'm also sticking to shopping lists so I don't overspend, or buy a bunch of impulsive gifts for people. I'm the worst at that! :)

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. What are your thoughts on Tati’s first palette? Overall, I think its a great palette as far as the textures, formulas and quality. The glitter did not budge all day! I even tried to rub some off with my finger before walking into to take Brooklyn to gymnastics and not a single speck came off! When I washed my face most of it did remove, but there was some left over in the morning. The only thing that I think will keep this from being a go to palette for me is the color selection. I think it its a great palette for those that like bold, very warm looks. But I wish there were more shades to create softer neutral looks with.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. In the end, I am keeping the Dyson Airwrap and I do really like it. I think it makes curling my hair and achieving the look I want so much easier for me than a curling iron.. BUT... there is a lot of other info in this video to consider before you shell out $549 for this dryer. I hope this video helps you make an informed decision whether to purchase or pass on this product.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. I know I spoiled the ending with the title, but you know I am terrible with secrets! :) I really LOVE this foundation. Its pretty amazing... It looks SO natural, and leaves the skin looking so healthy. Its not a Full Coverage Foundation, so if you need a lot of coverage, this one is not for you. but if you need natural to medium, have dry skin, have textured skin, or have dull skin, this foundation really does give your skin life! Its so pretty.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video.  Sorry my schedule has been a little sporadic lately. Lots of traveling, and we've had some sickness hit our house, so kids have been missing school a bit the last couple of week. I have them both home today. So grateful for having the flexibility to work around all the curveballs. :) Hope your week is going well!

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. I couldn’t be more proud to partner with Kendra Scott for their Ambassador Program this year. The brand aligns with so many of my values as a mother, woman and brand owner myself. Kendra’s story is nothing short of incredibly inspirational. I am inspired by her entrepreneurial spirit, and her heart to give back and “do good” in everything she has built this brand to be. 

I hope you enjoy this tour of the Kendra Scott home office in Austin, TX. It was such a fun project to work on with them and with my incredibly talented videographer Andre https://www.instagram.com/andrekreative/

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. I hope this helps and answers all your questions regarding how to clean your brushes. 

In regards to storing your brushes. I like to store mine in a brush cup standing upright and I also store my overflow brushes in a drawer but I have them laying flat in a drawer organizer tray I got from Target. The benefit to storing in a drawer is that they wont get dust on them if you have a home that has a lot of dust. I don't have an issue with my brushes on the counter , because I clean them about every 2 weeks and use them daily. If you store them in a drawer, I would recommend getting a tray that can separate them from other products you may store in your drawer so they don't get damaged. Personally I am not a fan of a brush roll unless I am traveling. They can easily damage the shape of the brush head especially your brushes that have a longer, fluffier head. 

I clean my brushes about every 2 weeks. Foundation or concealer brushes may need weekly cleaning.

8/10 KIND SHOP within NORDSTROM Barton Creek Mall
Fashion Show is from 12:30-1p (I misspoke in the video, it is not at 10am)
I will be at the Kind Shop that day, with the exception of that half hour of hosting the Fashion Show within the mall. 

Hi Friends! I couldn't be more excited to share this video with you. This moment feels like a dream to me. So surreal. I would have never imagined that my passion for makeup would have led me down this path. I remember in my 20s trying so hard to latch onto a more traditional career path, but always finding myself coming back to makeup. 

I was a wedding makeup artist on weekends next to my 9-5 in advertising.  After having my girls, I turned to YouTube as my outlet to practice my passion, as I knew my days of wedding makeup were sadly ending. I am so grateful for what YouTube has brought into my life. This community, new friendships with other creators, and the opportunity to launch BK Beauty. 

Because of you, this passion has led me to today. xoxo ... Lisa",2019-07-30T13:00:04Z,PT18M22S,hd,2d,false,False,91156,2982,0,862,public

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. If you haven't seen my first video on Coolsculpting, check it out below. We answer a lot of FAQs on what it is, how it works and you get to see how the process goes during a treatment. 

Also, because I know I will get a lot of questions...the scar on my lower back is from a tattoo removal I did years ago. I didn't want to edit these images at all, even to remove that. I got a tattoo right at 18 and started to remove it a few years later. lol... left with this scar.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. What other high end products should I try? I will definitely report back on this mascara as I use it for another 4- 6 weeks and let you know if I notice any changes in my lashes. 

UPDATE since filming this... I have been wearing it the last 3 days and it wears really well. Doesn't flake at all, my lashes stay looking at long, and full all day long and keep a curl. Takes a little extra makeup remover to get it all out but otherwise its a winner as far as how it applies and wears. Will keep you posted on if it actually makes my lashes grow.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. Its time for MAY Favorites! I hope everyone is having a great kickstart to Summer! Yay!! We just got back from Disney World and it truly was magical! I had never been before, so it was just as special of a trip for me as it was for the girls. I had been wanting to wait until they were both old enough to remember this trip and I think this year was the perfect time for them both (7 and almost 5 years old). We had the best time! We went to Epcot, Magic Kingdom, Typhoon Lagoon and Hollywood Studios.

JKoAbME4foU,"TOP 7 SKINCARE Anti Aging Skin in 30s, 40s, and 50s | COLLAB","Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video.  These are my some of my most used skincare products. I have pretty normal skin with an oily t zone. I have noticeable pores on my cheek, very fine lines around my eyes, pretty even skin tone with the exception of a few sun spots but nothing that is super noticeable. The Maelove Vitamin C Serum has helped SO much brighten my skin this last year and even it out.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. This is something I have been wanting to do for a long time, to lose some very stubborn pocket of fat that healthy eating and exercise just weren't able to get rid of. I have always preached a healthy balance with food and so I have been very careful about not letting myself get obsessive about what I eat or my workouts, since I have a history of issues with that. I am happy with my body, and in no way am I complaining about my body or criticizing it. But when I had the opportunity to do this procedure, I jumped on it because its non invasive, safe and I wanted to see the effectiveness of and be able to provide others considering it, my experience. I hope this is helpful!

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. This is one brand I was so excited to try! All products were sent to me but this video is not sponsored. Opinions are my honest first impressions. To speak on the foundation a bit more, it did wear really well on me throughout the day. It did require some touchups but it was very pretty. I do think I applied too much in this video though.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. We had SUCH a great time at the Gala! The event ended up raising $1.1 Million for our District! It was such a fun night! If you saw my Instagram Stories you saw we left Pauls phone in our Uber drivers car and had to find his apartment the next morning to try and get it back! We ended up finding his apartment and got it back! Thank goodness for the ""Find My IPhone"" Feature we were able to locate the exact location of his phone across town! LOL...

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. Paul and I are currently in Los Angeles working on some BK Beauty meetings and having such a blast! I met Marlena today from Makeup Geek, I ran into her at this show we were attending and she was so incredible sweet and kind. I actually met her about 10 years ago before all of her success and I can say she was just as sweet and kind today as I remember her being. I love when you meet someone you know online to be a certain way and they live up to that in real life. xoxox It was definitely a highlight for my week. xoxo

OwhgWkyNHWM,How To Find Your Foundation Undertone at The Drugstore With No Testers,"Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. I am hoping it is as helpful as I set out for it to be. This was such a great recommendation from a viewer! Identifying and understanding undertones can be so tricky especially because some brands use different names, or categorize them differently than others. To keep it simple I just try and identify shades that have more yellow or more pink and ones that are neutral and go from there.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. This is an honest and real look at my day. What I typically eat, and how I get in my exercise. A lot has changed in my diet and workout routine over the years. I have gone through phases where I punished myself with workouts (not enjoying it, but just overdoing it because I felt I needed to burn calories from over indulging the day before. I also use to be so restrictive in my diet, and didn't allow myself to enjoy some of the things I wanted. And if I did, I would over eat on them, because in my mind 1 cookie is equally as bad as 10, right?!?! I have such a healthier relationship with my body, and with food these days. I eat things that make me feel good, and I stay active by enjoying the things I love, my bike, running outside and barre classes. I may not be as tone and lean as I once was, but I can tell you I am a much happier person than I was in those years of my life. I hope this inspires you to treat and love yourself well. xoxox

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. This was fun to film. I have some a ton of educational videos planned so please subscribe if you aren't already. I am making 2019 the year to really focus on teaching in my videos. They are the style of videos I enjoy doing the most, thumbs up if you like educational videos! 

UPDATE: As The day went on I was very impressed with how matte my skin stayed. I think the egg whites ultimately did help tighten my skin and make my pores less noticeable and the corn starch I am certain helped keep my foundation on all day and keep it shine free.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video.  Ahh! Can't believe its pretty much 2019! I know I said that in my last video, but yes I am still in disbelief! Lol.. Hope you enjoy this long, chatty tutorial. :) Hope you all have a safe and wonderful New Years Eve however you celebrate. We will likely stay at home, as we do every year. Never in the mood to party, and I get nervous being out and driving home after midnight with the increase of drunk drivers on the road. If we do anything, it may be to go to my sister and brother in laws with the kids and sleep over, but still undecided. :) Happy NY everyone! xoxo

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. Can't believe 2018 is almost over! I hope you all had a Merry Christmas and Happy Holiday Season! I have been enjoying some sweet time with the girls home from school and taking a break from filming a little the last week. I'll probably have a light schedule next week and then resume with 3 videos per week after thy go back to school the second week of January. :) 

I am SO excited about announcing the launch of BK Beauty, and will have more apparel to share soon and working on some exciting things for 2019! We will always donate a portion of profits to spreading Kindness through organizations like The Kindness Campaign.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. As you can see my morning routine is pretty basic. All these products aside from the Opus Luxe Facial Cleansing Brush  I have been using for months. When I looked at the Opus Luxe, I knew this tool would be something I would enjoy because I have been using a Facial Cleansing brush for years and love how much better of a cleanse I get compared to my fingers. I really like the Opus Luxe, its design!

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. We had so much fun filming it. Katelyn is seriously such a talented makeup artist. I'll never forget watching her do makeup for the first time and being blown away! She's amazing, and this was such a treat. :) I'm so happy and proud of her for launching Salt New York. It really is a beautiful high end palette, if you end up getting one, let me know below. I would love to support her company. She built it all herself! xoxo #girlboss

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. I am loving this palette and when I saw Dominque's video I had to recreate this look! I did alter it a bit from her video, as I did not add the darker shade in Warm Cedar to the outter corner. This step was listed as an option on the Sephora Look Sheet, and I wanted to show another version of the look. I'm linking Dominique's Video below, check her's out to see this look on darker hair and eyes, and with a bit more glam to the outer corner!

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. I am seriously loving this palette. I know it doesn't look like anything special but I think that is what makes it so great. Its easy, its everyday, its neutral. And the quality of Natasha Denona's shadows are seriously some of the best in my book.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. I was pretty impressed with this palette. I hadn't heard of this brand before picking this up at Target so I had no expectations. But I really liked the color selection in the palette, you get a good warm theme for eyes and also a cool tone theme. The blush shades are also very nice and give a good range if you like the peachy and soft pink shades for cheeks. I feel like the palette really does cover the basics well for shade selection.

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. This was a spontaneous little video Brooklyn wanted to watch me film this past weekend. This palette was too fun and pretty to not play with and I decided it would be fun to film a quick tutorial. This palette was gifted to me from QVC, this video is not sponsored by QVC, but the corresponding blog post I made was. I really love it so much, I wanted to share it on my channel too! :) I am linking the blog post if you want to see a full palette swatch and hear about a few other products I received from Urban Decay and my thoughts on them.

Hi Friends! I hope you find this video helpful. I really enjoy sharing videos like this where my inner makeup artist geek gets to come out. :) Color Theory was one of my favorite topics to teach back when I was a Trainer at MAC. It was truly information that transformed my makeup skills to a new level and helped me look at makeup in a whole new light. I hope it helps you as much as it helped me. If you like this one, I would be so grateful if you shared it with your girlfriends. I hope its short and easy enough to follow that it really spreads and becomes a helpful resource for so many women. Thank you always for your support. xoxo Lisa

BROWN EYES: I'm reading all the comments, and I did not mean to intentionally leave out brown eyes. My apologies for the oversight! Brown eyes are very fortunate in that really any color you prefer to wear will look nice with brown eyes. Blues, Emeralds, and Purples look exceptionally stunning on brown eyes.

Hi Friends! So I legitimately filmed this, and titled it June Favorites. It wasn't until I designed the thumbnail and also titled it JUNE Favorites and then realized I already had a June Favorites thumbnail saved from last month that the bulb went off. That is the kind of month it has been. :) Juggling Kids Camps, and weeks of no camps, trying to film and trying to keep up has been a little more of challenge this month. But no complaints,  here. :) Just wanted to mention it because August may be a lighter month for me regarding uploads. Its the girls last month of Summer and I don't have any camps booked so my plan is to savor this time with them and make our time my priority. I may be more of a 2 video per week schedule, but we will see how it goes. :)

Hi Friends! Thank you for watching. I was so excited to try this new line of complexion products by ColourPop. I have always loved the lip products and eye shadows I have tried from the brand. I didn't want to watch any reviews on this product before filming this because I really wanted to go into with no expectations or assumptions. Sorry the video is so long but since I spent time reviewing the powders and concealers, It just ended up that way. Thanks for watching! xoxo Lisa

Hi Friends! Thank you for watching! This was SUCH a satisfying project for me. I have been wanting to take this task on for well over a year now.  It was not as daunting as I had been making it to be in my head. The staff at the Container Store were SO friendly and helpful and really helped guide me in the right direction. I can be so indecisive  especially on projects like this but they really helped me focus on finding the best most functional products that meet my aesthetic needs while in the budget I had to work with. It was such a fun and rewarding process My closet seriously feels like a boutique when I walk in and its the best feeling every morning. :)

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. It was recently requested in our Facebook Group to do a video explaining how to select a crease/transition shade and I thought why not elaborate a bit and share some basic tips that I do when I am doing eye makeup. I hope you find this video easy to follow and helpful. 
I would love to do more videos around makeup for beginners or share some basic tips for those who are just diving into makeup. Let me know if this was helpful at all. Thank you! xoxo Lisa

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. I had been searching for a good foundation for Summer that offered decent coverage, was long wearing but didn't look heavy. Something light weight and allowed my skin to breath. Please share with me your favorite foundations that check these boxes. I would love to know! xoxo Lisa

Hi Friends! I get a lot of questions on Keratin Treatments. What exactly it is, how long does it last, is it worth it etc... I wanted to take you along with me on my recent appointment to show you the process and results. I do have to say that getting them back to back (Its been about 4 months since my last one) I can definitely tell I got better results this time than last (even though I did like it the first time, this time my hair seems a little better). I have had it done in the past (years ago) but never got them consistently.. I would go 6 months or more between. Depending on where you go, prices will vary but to give you an idea Gracie charges $350-$400. I hope you enjoy this video. Thank you for watching. xoxo Lisa

Hi Friends! Yay for Favorites! I actually looked back at April and I didn't talk about as many products in that video that I thought I did in this one. I think I was thinking of other videos since that I have raved about some of these. Either way, I hope this video helps you discover some amazing new finds. These are all the beauty products and fashion items that I am loving currently. I feel like I have been shopping a little more lately than I typically do. I just love shopping Spring/Summer because it stays so hot here in Texas for so long that I know I will wear everything I buy so much. Its much harder for me to shop for cold weather clothes and shoes because I feel like I won't get to wear it as much. Anyhow, I hope you'll go say hi to Amanda! She's really awesome and I just love that I got to collab with her for this video.

Hi Friends! Its been a little while since my last try on video, I was feeling the need to update my Summer Tops and thought it would be fun to try on with you. I ended up purchasing a few of the pieces you see in this video and I have to say I love them all! If you like to see outfit try ons and fashion, make sure you are following me on Instagram because I will be sharing a ton more there moving forward. :) 

Most of the clothes I try on in this video are by the brand Madewell. I am LOVING that brand at the moment. Casual, comfortable but cute. I am not a Fashionista by any means and to be honest, comfort always out weights cuteness in my book. While I may scroll down Instagram at all the perfect, cute and trendy outfits... its just not me. I am all about being comfortable first. Also Madewell is priced very well. Most tops are in the $35-$55 range and they are timeless ... as in they aren't super trendy and will be out of style next year. By the way this video is NOT sponsored.

Hi Friends!  I am SO excited to finally have some fantastic drugstore anti aging skincare products to share with you! Over the last year or so I have been trying different skincare products, and can I just say it can get so overwhelming... so many options and so many different products. It can be difficult to know where to start or what products really yield results. I had heard about the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Line from Neutrogena from friends who swore by it so I was very excited to test it myself and work with Neutrogena on this video. I hope you enjoy it and please leave all your questions for me down below. xoxo Lisa

Hi Friends! Thank you for watching! I hope you enjoy this video. This is my go to look when I don't have time for eyeshadow and these lipsticks really pull the whole look together. You can always sub any of these lipsticks with your favorite lip color, I just find it looks more pulled together if the color is of a medium or dark tone. Very muted lips don't have the same effect.

Hi Friends! Thank you for watching! I hope you enjoy this video. Keep in mind, this is what I do and what works for me. I still allow myself to indulge when I am craving something such as dessert or a glass of wine. I don't restrict myself too much because it sends me into an unhealthy place with my body and relationship to food. I'm going to link my past videos on my weight loss journey, and past fitness inspired videos I have done on my channel below. Thank you for all your love and support.

Hi Friends! 
I hope you enjoy my first VLOG! I'm pretty excited to share this with you and take you along to my First RewardStyle Conference. A BIG HUGE THANK YOU to YOU for making this opportunity for me. Your support of my videos and using the links I share to do your shopping is what helped me get here. I cannot express how grateful I am to you. I overheard that some bloggers don't like to share that they were invited to this and don't post about being there for fear of getting backlash from their subscribers/readers and it made me think to myself how grateful I am to have the love and support from all of you. I truly felt so much support from many of you who were excited and happy for me. I guess some people don't feel bloggers or you tubers should be able to monetize their work by using affiliate links. I will always be transparent, and honest to you all in everything I share. I thank you for the bottom of my heart for making it possible for me to be able to turn my passion into something that supports an income and allows me to do this as a career. I was thinking about it the other day, and it wasn't until 3 years on YouTube (and over 160 videos) that I even made 1 cent off any of my videos. Lol... clearly its a passion and love and  I pinch myself that I am here. A million thank yous would never be enough. XOXO... Grab some coffee or a glass of wine.. this one is long.... :) 
I just realized I got my days wrong in the first few minutes.. I said it was Wednesday but it was Thursday... this is how my brain operates before coffee. 

Bloggers and YouTubers I met- If you follow them tell them I said HI :):

Hi Friends! Thank you for watching. I really enjoy these types of videos because they are real, deep and come from a place where I hope my experiences can help in some way whether you relate to some of my struggles or you find some slither of inspiration or motivation from my words. I wasn't expecting to get so emotional in this, but sometimes that happens when I am thinking of my struggles and how I can learn from them to be a better example for my girls. I'm sure some of you moms can relate. :) xoxo I'm linking the original videos I uploaded a few years ago about how I lost the weight along with a blog I wrote last year that I am proud to share. xoxox

Hi Friends! I hope you enjoy this video. I get asked all the time about my hair color and cut so I asked Gracie is I could film my appointment and pick her brain about what exactly she does on my hair. I am linking products she mentioned and I asked her to recommend some alternative products that are not as expensive as the Oribe line. I do love their line and splurge on some of their products but I totally understand the price point is pretty high so she gave 2 alternate lines that are not quite so pricey. :)

Hi Friends! Thank you for watching! We had a great trip to NYC last week. It was short and sweet and nice to have a little time away from the kids and have a full day in NYC. Paul had a work trip so I just tagged along. We had 1 full day there and while he was working I explored the city with lots of shopping walking up and down 5th Avenue. I think the most impressive store I walked into was Saks 5th Avenue... on 5th Avenue. I felt like Pretty Woman,  minus the ""working girl"" ;) part and minus the mean sales ladies... so actually I guess I didn't feel like Pretty Woman. haha! I just felt a little out of place I guess. But it was such a beautiful store! Upstair they had a cafe and I asked for a coconut milk latte and while they didn't have Coconut Milk, they had OAT MILK. Say Wha??? Oat Milk?? Apparently that is the new thing.. you heard it here first. :) It was actually pretty good. :) 
Anyhow...I hope you enjoy this video. Thank you for all your support and love...Lisa

Hi Friends! 
Thank you for watching! I Hope you enjoy this Throw Back Thursday Tutorial Using the Sweet Peach Palette. This is one of the most hyped palettes I remember buying when it launched. So funny… I needed it SOOOO bad when it launched yet I rarely use it now. :) Creating this look reminds me to grab this one on occasion, I think its really pretty! I am linking the photographer below who shot our portraits. She’s amazing and also did our family photos in December. I will share the final images from our shoot on Instagram as soon as they are ready. :)

I filmed these on the same day and I got mixed up when filming. Here is the link to that video: https://youtu.be/b3Mk1M2cJl4

Hi friends! Thank you for watching, liking, commenting and sharing my content. I bought these two drugstore foundations the same day and decided it would be fun to do a comparison of the two since they are fairly similar in claims (long wear, good coverage). Hope this is helpful. Let me know any questions you have and if you liked this style of video... comparing 2 similar foundations.

Hey friends! Thank you for watching! I get a lot of questions about my lash extensions so I thought it was time to film an updated video on them. I filmed a video on lash extensions years ago when I first started my channel. Its crazy to see how far I have come in my videos since filming this one. Why I thought I needed to wear that much makeup is beyond me..lol.. but at least I can laugh at it today and be proud that I am still here almost 4 years later and improving. :) If you care to watch it, its here: https://youtu.be/8xIhGn75Sbc

My Lash Stylist: 
https://www.lashgalaustin.com/ - tell her I sent you! She’s lovely! 

Lash Serums I have used (All work, some work faster than others but they have all worked. The one that I would say worked the fastest is the Rodan+Fields Lash Boost (Its also the most expensive), the Nutraluxe Lash is the second runner up and more affordable.

60OxPXNTUGA,My Current Skincare Routine Day & Night | Lisa J Makeup,"ALL INFO DOWN BELOW! Please subscribe before you leave! 
http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! Thank you for watching! I get so many questions on my skincare routine. For the longest time I used R+F exclusively and didn't really switch anything up. I started trying new products maybe a year or so ago. I went through a few months where I was trying too much and realized I really needed to stick to the same products for a while and not mix it up so much. Its difficult to see what's working and what is not when you try too many products and switch it up too much. I've been using this combo of products for the last couple of months and I really like where my skin is at when I am using all of these together. 
Leave your questions below. Thanks for watching! xoxo 

Oh, I ended up having to cancel my trip to Cancun... my daughter has the flu! :(

Hey friends! Thank you for watching! And thanks for all the support on my last video using the Chocolate Bar Palette. I was so pleased to see that many of you would love to see videos using older palettes. I even had the awesome suggestion to do a ""Throwback Thursday"" series where I use older palettes. May steal that idea! ;) 
I hope you enjoy this review on the Too Faced Peach Perfect Foundation. Leave your questions and comments below. Hope you all are having a Happy New Year! 

I also want to thank everyone who left me such sweet words about my Dog Harley's passing on New Years Eve. It has been a rough few days for me grieving over our loss. He was such a good boy, and I loved him so much. I'm sorry I couldn't reply to the comments on Instagram and on Facebook. I couldn't hold myself together to, but I wanted you to know I read them and I appreciate your condolences.

Hey friends! Thank you for watching! I thought it would be fun to revisit older eyeshadow palettes that aren’t getting much attention on YouTube anymore.

As always I keep it easy and simple to follow. xoxo…Lisa

0agypxQ-xrs,How to do your Makeup for Photographs | Lisa J Makeup,"ALL INFO DOWN BELOW! Please subscribe before you leave! 
http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! This video is extra special to me... I'm so happy to share these precious photos of my family with you (stick around to the very end). We have always taken family photos every year since my first daughter was born but last year, seemed to pass by and I never got around to scheduling them. It can be a lot of stress with young kids, planning the outfits, getting it all together, making sure the youngest has napped and is in good spirits... Gosh as I type that sentence I realize how trivial it all sounds... I found this year to be very easy, and stress free. I found the girls outfits at H&M, in a 20 minute shopping trip and I borrowed this sweater dress from a friend (I ended up ordering it for myself!:) And our photographer was amazing and go all of these photos in a 20 minute mini session! 
I hope my tips for makeup for photography are helpful for your next photoshoot or any special occasion when you know you may be photographed.

Hey friends! How is it already the end of 2017?! Does anyone else feel like this year has just flown by?? I say that every year, I guess and every year it seems to fly by quicker and quicker. I have some exciting videos planned for December and really excited about entering 2018! I have some big news (well Big to me :)... As of Feb 1, I will be transitioning to a Full Time YouTuber. So crazy to think I've reached this point where I can pursue this a little more seriously than I have been able to by juggling so much the last 3 years. I feel truly fortunate and grateful. It's still a couple of months away, but I wanted to give my employment plenty of time to prepare for me to transition away. They are the best people I've ever worked for and I'm hoping that I always have an opportunity to return if I need to. Ok, enough about that.. hope you enjoy my Favorites this month!

p55bP7_1jwI,Dior Airflash Foundation Review and Demo | Is it as good as Airbrush Foundation? | Lisa J Makeup,"ALL INFO DOWN BELOW! Please subscribe before you leave! 
http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! Thank you for watching. This foundation review was highly requested after I shared this foundation in a recent Sephora Recommendations Video and realized I had never featured this foundation on my channel. I've had it for a while now, but I purchased the wrong shade so I don't wear it very often. If you are wondering why one eye looks much more dramatic than the other in my thumbnail for this video... funny story for you... I had forgotten to take the thumbnail picture when I filmed this video last week and so I took it a week later after filming a Hooded Eye Makeup Do and Don't video (which will be up soon)... so one of my eyes is the ""Dos"" and one is the ""Don't"" lol... just had to disclose that :)

If you are looking for convenient, challenging and effective workouts you can do at home, you should find this review helpful. I had tried another app earlier this summer that had fewer options, was twice the cost, and the interactivity of the app was not as fun and motivating at the BOD app. You can check out the membership options and how to get a Free Trial at

PnwGyU8M23k,10 Products to Pick Up at the Sephora Friends and Family Sale,"ALL INFO DOWN BELOW! Please subscribe before you leave! 
http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! The Sephora Friends and Family Sale is currently underway. If you have received a discount code from a friend or family member who is a Sephora Employee, you can shop the sale and get 20% your ENTIRE PURCHASE from 10/14-10/21. From what I understand it is a one time purchase, so better to stock up on everything you think you need and just return or exchange if you need to. Once you use the code, it is no longer active for future purchases. Just an FYI. You also must be of Beauty Insider Status, or VIB. If you miss out on this sale, no worries… the next 20% sale is next month as Sephora gears up for Holiday and you know I will be covering that sale as well.

Hey friends! An update on my daughter... I filmed this the day before we had her following up appointment with the Neurologist. She had an EEG the next day which looks at electrical activity in the brain. The results were normal and no unusual activity was monitored which was great news to hear! It still leaves us with little answers as to what caused her seizure, but the doctor said it is ""unlikely"" it will happen again. So at this point, we are just thankful for a good diagnosis, and hopeful it was a freak occurrence that won't happen again. I may only have 2 videos a week for the next couple of weeks while I try and catch up. Hope you like this one on my favorite products for September! Have a great week! xoxo ...Lisa

Hey friends! I had such a great weekend in Dallas last week. I haven't been able to attend The Makeup Show in over a decade, so it was exciting to be able to make it this year! There weren't as many big brands like I remember seeing the last time I went. I picked up some products at the show and then at the new Sephora in Northpark Mall. What is it about being out of town or on vacation that makes you feel like shopping more? Like, I couldn't get these products at my own Sephora?! lol... anyone else?? Either way, I had a GREAT time visiting a great friend!

Hey friends! I hope you enjoy this makeup tutorial. Even though its still 90 degree temps in Texas, its almost October which means its time for a Fall Makeup Look. When I think of Fall inspired makeup, I think of fuller coverage foundation, warm matte neutrals on the eyes, a slightly deeper lip than my norm and overall just having a tad bit more made up look. Let me know what you think down below!

http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! I featured this foundation in my last Favorites Video, and it was requested to do a full review/wear test on this foundation and concealer. It is such a beautiful foundation, there are some differences between this and their Ultra Foundation. I think this one is a dry skin's dream but an oily skin may not like this. It does require more touchups and maintenance through the day, especially if you have an oilier skin type or live in a  humid climate. But its so beautiful. Its still a favorite of mine. Gorgeous for a light to medium coverage. Hope you enjoy!

Hey friends! Thank you for watching! I'm so excited to parter with Stephanie Marie on this video. Be sure and check out her Top 5 Picks for Light/Medium Coverage CC and BB Creams for Oily, Mature Skin. I chose my top 5 medium to full coverage foundation picks for my video because I feel like finding full coverage foundations that wear well and don't look too heavy can sometimes be a challenge. Especially on more mature skin. The foundations I picked really work well on all ages, but when applied correctly, I think these are some of the best for mature skin. I hope you enjoy!

http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! Thank you for watching my videos. I've been curious about Dermaplaning for a while now and when my friend Allison Bingham offered for me to try out the service I thought this would be something you all might be curious about or interested in learning more about. A Dermaplane facial is basically an aggressive exfoliation to the skin using a blade to remove the top layer of dead skin cells, and all facial hair. Its pretty amazing and one that I will likely want to keep up with! In the video I answer all the typical questions about cost, maintenance and what it is. Hope you enjoy! 

Disclosure: this video is not sponsored but services were complimentary. I chose this service because I felt this would be most interesting to my subscribers. 

If you are in Austin or the surrounding areas you can check out Allison at:

Thank you for watching and for always being the most supportive, and encouraging community here. Xoxo

EO82T9RLpgw,5 Concealers + Tips for Mature Skin | Lisa J Makeup,"ALL INFO DOWN BELOW! Please subscribe before you leave! 
http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! I debated on what to title this video. My Mature Skin series does really well, but I wanted to be clear that to me ""mature skin"" doesn't have an age number assigned to it. I'm 34 and I can't wear my makeup like I did when I was 24, and I know when I'm 44 it may change again. But as a makeup artist, I know what types of products work well on all skin types, and I think these 5 concealers are generally good for skin that has any texture under the eyes. Hope you enjoy! Thank you for watching and please connect with me below. Also, thank you for those that responded to my newsletter this week and requested this video.

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! I hadn't heard much about this foundation yet, so had no idea what to expect. I actually went into Ulta looking for the new IT Cosmetics foundation but my store didn't have it, so they pointed me to try this new one from Bare Minerals. Hope you enjoy the video!

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! I'm so excited to share this workout with you. I recently discovered the Onnit Academy Gym here in Austin, and LOVE it! It's what I need right now to make real changes in my body. I love running and cycling but those are the only consistent exercises I do, so I'm really lacking strength and core training. I also have had problems with lower back pain so have been hesitant to do any heavy weighted exercises. The movements I did in the classes at Onnit, where like nothing I had done in a group exercise program. They were challenging, I was sweating, but I also felt like they were good for the supportive joints. Hard to explain, but really I just felt like I was maximizing my output with slower, controlled movements that i wasn't worried about throwing out my back while doing. I knew I wanted to do a workout video for you guys, and was so thrilled when they agreed to let me borrow Cristian to walk you through it. Really great stuff here! I'm leaving the workout with rep info down below.

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! Sorry this is so late. By the time I got this box, I had already filmed a few weeks worth of content to cover the week of our vacation and the week we returned. Either way, I though this would be good to upload because it gives you an idea of what you get in the Beauty Fix Subscription Box. It is $24.95 month and you get at least 5 products mostly full or deluxe sized samples. 

This video is not sponsored. Dermstore did send me this box but I was not asked to produce a video in return.

aAPJMMMGCOY,My Scary Story about Aspartame Poisoning | Feel Good Friday,"ALL INFO DOWN BELOW! Please subscribe before you leave! 
http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! I've wanted to share this story in its own video for a while now. I talked about it in my Weight Loss Story video I posted a few years ago, but since a lot of you may not have been subscribed to my channel then, I thought this topic was a good one to address in a Feel Good Friday. This experience opened up my eyes to how toxic aspartame can be to our bodies. It was a very scary experience, and I wanted to share it with others. Now I'm not saying I NEVER have it anymore, but I do avoid it as much as possible. The only things I consume that still have it are a diet soda here and there. But I learned from this that just because something is 0 calories or sugar free, doesn't mean its helping in your weight loss attempts.

jIbyc4klOZs,How I Make Bulletproof (Butter) Coffee | Feel Good Friday,"ALL INFO DOWN BELOW! Please subscribe before you leave! 
http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! I started making Bulletproof Coffee about a year and half ago when I met with a nutritionist and discovered I wasn't getting enough healthy fats in my diet which was causing me to have uncontrollable cravings every night. I started drinking my coffee with grass fed butter in the mornings and added more avocado, and nuts to my diet and noticed a change almost immediately! I would sometimes add Collagen Protein powder to make it a little more hearty and filling to replace breakfast. I'm listing the ingredients below, and I'll link the Magic Bullet blender and the Collagen Protein I ordered below. 

Ingredients:
Cup of Coffee
Kerrygold Grass Fed Butter Unsalted
Cinnamon
Vanilla Stevia sweetner
MCT Oil

I think the Keratin treatment helped give me some confidence that I CAN manage my own hair. LOL…  For the longest time I would just dry it roughly then use a flat iron to smooth it out. Now I rarely have to use my flat iron, and this style gives me more volume. I hope you enjoy!

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! This will be my last Nordstrom Anniversary Video. I finished up all my shopping and wanted to share the clothing items I purchased. Some of the items here are not all sale items but for the most part everything in this video is very budget friendly. Most tops are under $50 and jeans are all under $100. I really don’t purchase high priced clothing very often, my style is casual and comfortable. Hope you enjoy this video! Let me know what you think below.

http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! I brought my new Vlog Camera with me to Punta Cana and filmed this little casual tutorial on the makeup I was pretty much wearing daily. Lots of Sun Protection, with minimal fuss. Thank you all for the sweet comments congratulating us on 10 years! This trip was exactly what we needed. We had a great time! We stayed at the new Secrets Cap Cana Resort and loved it! Really friendly staff, great food, beautiful beach! We upgraded to the preferred club part of the resort and I recommend doing that if you look at this resort. Lots of perks and private beach area. Really nice and relaxing! 

I wrote this blog post while we are on vacation about marriage and parenthood and I'd love to know what you think!

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! So funny… I started this video out by saying I was only packing the essentials but as I edited this, it seemed like A LOT! Ha! What do you think? Do you pack more or less when you travel to the beach? I have a feeling I will wear probably half of these products but since we are celebrating a big milestone in our marriage I want to have enough products to glam it up one night if we decide to get fancy and go some place nice for dinner. :)

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! I've got a favorites video to share this month. I don't do these videos every month, just because I like to accumulate enough products that I am actually really loving, and sometimes I don't have enough to create a video for every month. Hope you enjoy! Let me know what you are loving! I'm excited to try the NYX brow pencil after so many of you raved about it! I bought the Milani primer thanks to you and LOVE it! Please share with me what you love too!

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! After I posted my Eye Makeup for Mature Skin Video last week, I had a TON of requests to film my mom's makeup, so here it is! She doesn't wear much makeup and so this was fun for me to doll her up. She gets a little emotional in the beginning... :) She said she was just emotional because she's proud of me. :) I clearly get my sensitive and sentimental side from her. Love her! I hope y'all enjoy!

4_1ESwjHRiE,Peloton Bike Review and Full Dashboard Demo | Worth it?,"ALL INFO DOWN BELOW! Please subscribe before you leave! 
http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! This has been a pretty requested video for me to film a review and walk through of my new-ish Peloton Bike. If you follow me on Instagram you know I got this bike for my birthday earlier in the year. I fell IN LOVE with Indoor Cycling Classes last year after I discovered some rhythm based cycling class studios near my house through Class Pass. I become OBSESSED with this cardio class. It is so fun! I somehow convinced my husband to let me buy this bike. I had actually bought a step machine only a few months before so I had to sell it before I could buy this. Even though I lost some money on that machine, I have  no regrets. I LOVE this bike. 
I've never been able to workout at home and stay motivated. But this bike makes it so much fun and so challenging. If you are considering buying this bike, or considering buying a cardio machine for your home, I hope this video helps you make an informed decision. 
Also, be sure to download the app from Peloton for free for a few weeks so you get an idea of what the classes are like. 

USE THIS CODE AND GET $100 towards any bike accessories when you purchase the Peloton

Something about watching people get their makeup done, is so relaxing to me. Ha! This is my beautiful friend Nasreen!

Her Instagram is

qGL887gSnrA,First Impression on the NEW Revlon FX Foundation for Mature Skin,"ALL INFO DOWN BELOW! Please subscribe before you leave! 
http://bit.ly/2n4Wl8J

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! When I walked by the new Revlon FX Foundation and Concealer and saw it was marketed for mature skin, I had to try it! 

Sadly I was pretty disappointed in this foundation but I do love the concealer! I didn't do a follow up check up on this foundation like I normally do in Foundation Reviews, sorry! It was a hectic day and I didn't get a chance to check back in. Don't worry, my future foundation reviews will be my normal style where I check back in with updates. 

But... I didn't like this foundation at all. It felt very sticky and I don't think it blurred lines at all on my skin like it claims to do. It also didn't cover well for my skin. I was not a fan. It reminded me of a very sticky, thick tinted moisturizer to be honest. The only positive to me on this is the SPF of 20. Other than that, I can't recommend this product. The concealer on the other hand is a different story! I really like it!

Hey guys! I am very hesitant to share this video. I know Botox is a sensitive subject, there are different opinions on the subject on both ends good and bad. But I did get it for the first time a few months ago, and decided to go back for my second treatment. I wanted to take you with me, show you the procedure and answer some common questions. 

I am 34 years old and had been considering getting it for quite a while. I have a lot of friends who get it, and the results are not permanent so I became comfortable with trying it out. I was pretty blown away with the results (my first before and after photos are in the video). 

I went back and forth on sharing this and opening myself up to criticism but decided to go ahead and post it.I can respect everyone's opinions and decisions as it comes to botox, or any plastic surgery and I hope people can respect mine.

Hey friends! Thanks for watching! Blush is one of my favorite products to apply and one that I never skip. Even the days when I’m going for the “no makeup” look, I always have to apply some color on my cheeks. It may sound ridiculous but even if I’m going for a fun outside, I apply blush. Gosh that sounds ridiculous. but its true. It gives my face life and a youthful look that I feel like I so desperately need these days! Ha! I thought it would be fun to share my favorite blushes, many of them you’ve seen me use in videos, but felt like these guys needed their own dedicated video to give them some love. :) Hope you enjoy!

Hi Friends! 

I hadn't heard ANYTHING about this new foundation from Covergirl yet so I had no expectations on how this would perform. This is actually the first Covergirl foundation I have ever tried. The foundation claims are full coverage, giving your skin a healthy glow. 

I do have to mention that in the video I said I found it online for $8, but now that I am uploaded and entering the details, I can't find it at that price. 


I found it on amazon for $9.99 here- I'm ""Buff Beige"" shade for reference 
http://bit.ly/2pPVdqk

I paid around $12 so if you have Amazon Prime, you get free shipping and that looks like the best price. Let me know if you find it somewhere else for less. 

Thanks for watching!

Hi Friends! 

I was thrilled to receive the Beauty Fix April Box from Dermstore. I am already a subscriber to Ipsy and Sephora Play and love getting these monthly beauty box surprises. 

I had high expectations of the Beauty Fix Box, since it is $24.95 per month vs the $10 I pay for Ipsy and for Sephora Play. When I received the box, I was very pleased with the products that were included in it. Not only were the brands, brands I had wanted to try, but the size of the products were either full or deluxe sized samples. 

I hope you enjoy this video, and let me know if you like (or don't like) Unboxing videos like this. I don't do them regularly on my channel, but if you would like to see more of them let me know!

Dermstore did send me this box, but this video is NOT sponsored. No direction (other than my honest review) was given to me to from Dermstore. Thank you Dermstore!

j22folTVuIg,Clip In Hair Extensions: How To Apply and Care for them,"All info below...

Here is the link to purchase http://bit.ly/IM_Hair3141

Thank you Gracie Silvas 
Www.beautylovegrace.com 
YouTube Beauty Love Grace 


Hey guys! I'm so excited to introduce Gracie to you! She's been my hair stylist and friend forEVER! We met when we were both working at Saks 5th Avenue when we were babies! I was 19 working at the MAC counter, and Gracie was working in the Salon. I've followed her to new salons, and even when I was living in San Antonio, I would make the trip to Austin to see her. She's so talented and just gets my hair. I'm so thankful she helped me show you all the best way to apply clip in hair extensions on yourself and how to care for them. 
Thank you Irresistible Me for sending me these! 

This video is not sponsored. 

I received the 20"" 200g Extensions from Irresistible Me last year. They are so soft and feel so incredible! Gracie colored them for  me when I darkened my hair last month, but by the time we got around to filming this, the dark color had faded on my hair and my highlights are more noticeable- so you'll notice the extensions are a little too dark to blend in perfectly. But you still see how to apply and take care of them. I'll probably color and cut these a couple of inches to be the perfect shade and length for me.

Hope you enjoy!

This has been my go to makeup look for the days when I have a little extra time to spend on my makeup, and want a glam but conservative look. These shades work well on any eye color but particularly GORGEOUS on blue or green eyes. The warmth from these neutral shades compliment green/blue making them pop and bring out the color.

This look is an easy go to for me when I’m getting ready for a night out but don’t have much time to think about my makeup. Its flattering on all eye colors, and skin tones, and its neutral enough to work with any outfit. You can glam it up with a black liner, or tone it down by leaving the lower lash line clean and skipping the false lashes. Its really a perfect look for any woman who likes a moderate amount of makeup, not too heavy and not too minimal. I hope you enjoy it!

Winged eyeliner can be a great way to elongate and give your eyes a lifted look.

The shade ranges are very forgiving. I can wear any between 4-6 so there is definitely wiggle room if you order one shade up or down.

Hey guys! I contacted Face Atelier asking why some people get the message that they don't ship to ""their country"" and also asked about all of the foundations being Yellow based and I got this response.
 
Thank you so much for your email and your continued support.  We ship worldwide so I’m not sure why you’re viewers are having difficulties, I suppose each situation is different but just let them know that they contact us at any point if they are having troubles.  To answer your other question, all of our foundations have a yellow base.  The odd numbered shades (1,3,5,7 etc.) have a slightly pinker tone to them than the even shades but still are all yellow based.",2017-02-06T18:33:39Z,PT11M55S,hd,2d,false,True,67656,1376,0,277,public

Hey guys! 
I had a lot of people ask if I got lip injections after my Ride or Die Tag Video I uploaded last month. I just overlined my lips using this technique so I thought I would share for all the ladies like me, who weren't given lots of volume in our lips. :)

7kfF2HDOEGk,"First Impression, Review and Demo: Estee Lauder Cushion Stick Foundation & Highligher","All info below... Don't forget to subscribe and let me know what foundations to review next!

I was so excited to try this foundation. When I first saw it online, I immediately started hunting down where I could get my hands on it first. I'm a fan of Estee Lauder's foundations (particularly their Double Wear full coverage liquid foundation) and also a fan of the cushion technology so I thought putting this into a stick applicator was genius! Honest review... I was disappointed in this product. While it's pretty when initially applied, I find the applicator almost pointless and the wearability is not long enough for me. Hope this video helps you in deciding whether this foundation is worth the purchase or not. Thanks for watching!

oe3ccuEjE88,August Favorites | Lisa J Makeup,"After some thought, I decided to take down the first Favorites video I posted earlier today, and edit out a part I talked about  an Herbal Cleanse I use and like. I don't want anyone to take my advice over their healthcare professional, and felt it may be irresponsible to recommend a product that they should really get the advice of a professional on. Thanks for everyone's feedback on the first video. I really consider it all.

9aV9aRGi6eA,April Favorite Beauty Products,"UPDATE ABOUT NEMAT OIL:: a subscriber commented that the reviews for the Nemat Oil on some Amazon links said the oil was a lesser quality, diluted and not as fragrant. I just got one in the mail that I ordered off Amazon and I found this to be true! 😔 if you can, buy from Whole Foods or read the reviews of sellers before you order. The one I just received IS NOT the same quality as the ones I buy from Whole Foods.

These are my current favorites. Most of these products I picked up at the Sephora VIB sale but some of these i’ve been using for a while, and wanted to share with you! Hope you enjoy!

AL210UVkBRY,New love for Buxom Shadows: Review and Swatch,"Hey guys! 
I stumbled across these at Ulta and without having heard anything about them, I bought a 6 pan customizable palette. These shadows have primer in them and I was told a primer is not necessary. I did wear them the first day without a primer and I did have some creasing by the end of the day but they are still a great quality shadow. With a primer, they are pretty amazing! 

LInk to Shop Buxom Shadows:
http://bit.ly/2rQXf6O

Shades I purchased:
Satin Seduction (Shimmery Icey White)
Champagne Buzz (Warm, champagne shimmer)
Famous Flirt (pale peach)
Invite Only (mid tone matte peach-)
Spoiled Sexy (mauve matte)
Filthy Rich (deeper warm brick)

I really like these shadows a lot and you get a great value when you purchase 6 and palette. 

Hope you enjoy the video!

6Z3u5OXvvo4,Natasha Denona Eyeshadow Palettes 05 Review,"hi Friends!
Thank you for watching! I was SO excited to get these palettes in and film this review. For brands like Natasha Denona where you can't easily try the product in store, and you are going strictly off the reviews of beauty bloggers and you tubers, I really hesitated buying them. I finally caved after seeing Wayne Goss' review on these and he described them as the best eye shadows in the world. 
Well, I'm happy I did. I really like these but I do think there are some other brands that compare in quality. I hope my review is helpful if you are like me and researching these before buying. 

Thank you all for watch as always- I love you!

meJf_HFURw8,Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Foundation Stick Review,"Please SUBSCRIBE***

This foundation has become my favorite every day foundation. I LOVE it. Its everything I want in a foundation. Super easy to apply, super light weight but still great coverage, matte (but not heavy or dry looking), and did I mention its SUPER EASY to apply? I just swipe a few swipes on my face (its very forgiving so you don't have to worry about applying too little or too much), and I use a real techniques brush to blend it out. It probably takes me 20 seconds.... seriously. And it's long wearing! I LOVE it so much!",2016-03-08T00:53:55Z,PT8M21S,hd,2d,false,True,18775,270,0,55,public
Uexd2E7z-fg,Clinique Beyond Perfecting Foundation + Concealer Review,"Hi everyone! 
 I was excited to try this foundation after hearing such amazing things about it. I do like it, I wouldn't say its made my list of favorites yet. Its great for oily skin types, or people who want a full flawless coverage and matte finish. Its a thicker texture and highly pigmented so you have to make sure to not apply too much. It reminds me of the Marc Jacobs Remarcable Formula a bit. 

This video is my honest opinions on this product- good and bad. Hope it help! Let me know what you think of this product if you've tried. it.

By the way... I'm the shade Alabaster

DISCOUNT CODE:   lisajmakeup

GIVEWAY IS CLOSED**


Hi everyone! I am so excited to share this product with you. I’ve been using the Smile Brilliant Teeth Whitening Kit since the beginning of the year and am really happy with my results. I drink coffee every day and on occasion red wine, so keeping my teeth white is something that concerns me. I’ve tried other systems in the past, some good, some ok and some disappointing. I was really excited when I learned that Smile Brilliant makes custom teeth trays for you to use with their system and also that they include a product to help with sensitivity-because I have super sensitive teeth. 

Disclaimer** This video is sponsored by Smile Brilliant, and they did send me their product to use. My review is my honest opinion and my experience with their product.",2016-02-17T23:08:28Z,PT9M1S,hd,2d,false,True,1481,46,0,14,public

6xLwRh-i3Yw,How To: Flat Iron on Natural Hair  {Nume Flat Iron + Styling Products I Use},"READ ME***

Hi Everyone, 

I don't do much to my hair but I do wear it sleek and straight most days. I have naturally thick and semi wavy hair (really just messy and whacky looking). Its pretty stubborn so doing elaborate styles doesn't really work well with my hair because it generally pushes back or weighs down by the end of the day. 

I know this is a simple style but I've had a lot of requests to film it so here it is. :) 

Products I use:
Loma Repairitive Tonic (LOVE THIS STUFF)
Oribe Shine Spray
Dry Bar Shampoo

NUME Styling Tools- I have the flat iron and the largest curling wand, hair dryer. Love them. Google Nume Coupon codes before buying though- they always have them.",2016-02-01T05:24:39Z,PT13M21S,hd,2d,false,True,6651,175,0,22,public

DNO75uV0sXU,How I lost 40 lbs: My weight loss story,"Hey guys! Venturing off a bit from my beauty videos with this one but after sharing my Get To Know Me Video, I got a lot of requests from you to share more about how I lost weight years ago. Fitness and Nutrition is a BIG part of who I am today. I've learned A LOT over the last decade on my journey of losing weight and keeping it off. 

Sorry this video is kind of a long ramble, but its a subject I am very passionate about and I didn't want to filter or plan out what I was going to say in this. I wanted to be very honest about my journey and my feelings on the subject. 

I hope you enjoy and I hope it helps you or someone you know. Let me know below! And if you liked this and want more specifics on diet and exercise tips let me know too.
