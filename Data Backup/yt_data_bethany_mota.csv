ZcOCqmd6Nfk,I HAVE A SECRET!!!!! Make Your Mind Up | Book Trailer,"Hey Guys! 

BIG ANNOUNCEMENT! I’m releasing my debut book, “Make Your Mind Up.” 

“Make Your Mind Up” is now available for pre-order:
http://bit.ly/MakeYourMindUpBook 

From tips on life, love, and everything in between; to original DIYs, recipes, and style hacks; to my personal story. Make Your Mind Up is the ultimate guide to rocking your look and ruling your world! 

When I first propped my camera on a stack of books and pressed record on my family’s handheld camera in 2009, I didn't realize my life was about to change—forever. Since then, I have filmed countless room tours and tutorials, traveled the world, experimented with hundreds of DIYs, designed my own clothing line, gone on an international tour, competed on Dancing with the Stars, and you guys - my #MotaFam have been there every step of the way! 

I’m just a girl who is learning how to forge my own positive path, Make Your Mind Up is more than just a heartwarming memoir or lifestyle guide—this is a portrait of my life, and exactly how I live it!
