It's important to me to empower the next generation of content creators and music artists and help them drive the future of the creative economy.

I've always invested in things that I believe in, and with¬†Thematic, it was to solve an existing problem I had as a content creator. Music is very important to me in my storytelling process, but I would often waste so much time trying to find the right song or run into rights issues that led to demonetization, or in my case, litigation.

With¬†Thematic, I wanted to provide an easier way to connect content creators and music artists and bring these communities together.

SN5qVrkTEA8,‚ú¶   2015  FALL  LOOKBOOK  ‚úß,"Hi beautifuls! This is what happens when you and your creative friends meet up.  We decided to experiment with a look book video inspired by our favorite fall beauty + fashion styles. The vibe we were going for was futuristic anime street fashion. üòéWe had no storyline or narrative, just went around the city to find cool places to shoot and role play....I think we went for that secret spy vibe or something like that. Haha! üòÇEnjoy this fun experimental video and let us know what you think! Halloween is coming up, if you have any requests for a costume look, comment below!  Don't forget to share your style and tag us so that we can find it and like it! Love you!  x Mish

DgylJ41UQBM,Travel Diary : KOREA,"Shout out to the third wheelers, who were this production crew that filmed many popular Kpop music videos. They directed us recreate a few "" romantic "" Kdrama scenes like "" frolicking through the field while holding hands "" haha. I love being cheesy I don't care.



It's not about the destination, it's about the company :) Korea was one of the most beautiful countries I've ever experienced. The food, beauty, nature and culture really inspired me. Hope this ignites your wanderlust. xoxo Mish

However, if you want to play and change up your looks, here is an easy non invasive way to create fuller lips :) You are in control of how you look, have fun and be creative, but most importantly, BE YOU! :)

It doesn't matter if you don't have a frontal camera lens on your phone, the tips in this video on how to take the perfect selfie will work for all cameras. This day in age, having a good profile picture can be seen as being just as important as having a good driver's license photo!

The only difference is that with a selfie, you're in control! Capture the best version of yourself with a few easy tips that I'm going to demonstrate!

Erm7Q3XlJtA,1 Minute DIY : Olive Oil + Honey Mask,"Hello my bunnies! 1 Minute DIY is a New series I'm starting for this year. Simple, bite sized tutorials. Don't worry, I'll still have my beauty, makeup, fashion and other tutorials :) 

This olive oil and honey mask will NOT make your skin oily. Extra Olive Oil has been used for centuries to hydrate the skin, and it doesn't clog pores! Amazing huh? :) It's the golden miracle alongside with Honey. Mix the two together, and you'll have a beautiful natural skin hydrating mask that works well for those who have sensitive to normal skin :) Those with dry, oily, normal, combination skin, you can use this mask :) I recommend twice a week!

Please don't forget to subscribe :D

Sorry no voiceover in this video, I caught the cold that everyone's been getting so it sounds a lil groggly. I'm going to drink some Manuka honey tea, it helps when you're sick :) All natural! :D

There are different selections of red wine, you have Merlot which is the softest, easiest wine to drink. It's sweet with a fruity flavor, but it's very mild. Cabernet Sauvignon has more of an earthy oak flavor. It's stronger in taste because of the grape's thick skin. Pinot Noir has existed for over 2 thousand years. It has the most delicate taste, personally, it's my favorite. There are more types, but for this tutorial, any red wine will do. 

Thanks to Dr. Kathrina Agatep for correcting my smile and jaw! She's the best on the West Coast for TMJ treatments!

*Note* I've been noticing a lot of people are commenting about ""Who would wear this in public?"". I wanted to let you guys know that this is a fun fashion video, fashion doesn't always have to be taken so seriously. This is something you can do at home with your family/friends (maybe even a slumber party) . I wore this look out after the video and got a lot of compliments on the skirt! The idea of this video is taking something ordinary and finding different uses out of it! Fashion should be fun and creative  :) Love you guys!

L46NH_iytGY,My 200th Video! Meet Ashlynn,"http://www.wish.org/

Ashlynn's story

Going through the whole cycle of having cancer was both positive and negative for me. The negative effects were that I was sick and felt awful for a long time but, through all the pain I found who I was. I don't believe if I hadn't gone through what I did, I wouldn't be as good as a person. I became closer to God and He helped me through everything that came my way. It all started on April 16th 2009. I was 11 and started experiencing chest pains. The previous Sunday we had almost come a hair on having a wreck and I had slammed again the back of the seat incredibly hard. My mother and I thought maybe I had bruised my ribs. All through that week it had been difficult to breath without it being very painful. Finally come Thursday it had gotten even worse and I passed out, not being able to walk and I went pale. My grandparents rushed me to the hospital where I stayed a couple of days. About the third day I was diagnosed with Lyphomblasic Lymphoma. Which was a huge mass in my lung which caused it to collapse. I started chemo in just a few days and immeditly it disappeared. I still had to continue it for three years though. Through all the pain and suffering I had to deal with I'm so glad I had all of my family there for me through the whole thing. Also I thank God for always watching over me and easing some of the pain for me. That's my story c: -Ashlynn

Ashlynn and I spent the day together playing with makeup and hanging out. She wanted to film a tutorial and decided on a look inspired by Alice in Wonderland. Taking life for granted is something that I know I do, but meeting Ashlynn and hearing her story was a big reminder on how precious life is. I hope her story inspires you too.

Thank you Daven, my hair BFF for styling my hair.

Thanks to my awesome friends for filming, lighting and running around with me like a crazy woman till 2 am after a Lakers game. I was inspired to film a love story between two lovers who decide to reunite at midnight on new years :)

A lot of people asked what inspired this story. Honestly, I was super bored on Sunday and was inspired to film a short mini love story. So the next day on Monday, I called up all my friends and told them to meet me at my place at 7 pm. They all came and I drew out my idea and storyboarded it, and we all went DT LA and filmed it guerrilla style. Took us 4 hours but we finished it. So what you see before you is EXACTLY what I envisioned :)

iVmtZsr8FfA,Hatsune Miku Makeup,"Who has turquoise hair, can sing any Japanese songs you like and drives a Toyota Corolla? Hatsune Miku.

You're looking at her, and this video can show you how to look like her. This video would work well for those who want to dress up like Miku at her concerts, anime events and expos and more! ( fyi, Miku doesn't wear hairbands, but I had to wear a few because I was in the desert filming this scene. It was so windy, my hair was flapping everywhere and getting all tangled. How did Rapunzel do it?! Seriously!)

Hatsune Miku is a vocaloid, she's not an anime or hologram,  this video explains it pretty well and shows you how to use the vocaloid program. It may seem new to you, but it's been around in Japan for a while. Very cool stuff. http://youtu.be/SIOr5UWxPz0

If you wanna check out really cool Hatsune Miku cosplay, you can find a lot on Google Image!  I saw a bunch when I went to Akihabara while I was in Japan last week! Even men dress up like her, I was shocked! Haha!

leoxb6KIQ58,Layering Skin Care : Night Time,"Layering skin care products is very popular in Asia. A poll showed how women in Asia would use about an average of 9 skin care products on a daily basis! So skin care is taken very very seriously. I'm not using 9 products here, but I am layering my products. This is my favorite method and it's best for night time. Daytime, you want to use a technique that's requires lighter layers. I also recommend sleeping on your back, because not only is it better for your body, but it's better for your face. Enjoy!

4lMEWyARJqw,4 Different Chinese Girl Looks,"You do not have to be Chinese to wear these looks! Haha, the reason for the title is because while I was in Beijing for a PR event for Lancome, I was asked by the Lancome fans in China to create 4 simple but different Chinese girl looks. A simple look, an office look, a dating look and a party look. I also decided to also use the eyeshadow sponge applicators and fingers because this is a very popular way to apply makeup (rather than brushes). Each look is very wearable, sweet and simple. Please enjoy!

FYI, this was also filmed with my old Canon camcorder, not my new one. So it's not as HD as my other videos. Also, the reason why I had to compromise a lot of products (like the eyeliner blow dryer part) was because I wasn't given a lot of products. (Notice how I use some of the same products over and over?) But, that's a good thing because this just comes to show you how you don't need a suitcase full of makeup to create different looks :)

SZwaKDaSgqY,Black Swan Makeup,"I didn't see the movie when I created this look, so if it's not 100% accurate I apologize. Natalie Portman is one of my favorite actresses and I fell in love with this dark look. I've always been a fan of Swan Lake and I was so excited that she was going to play as a ballerina! Please enjoy this tutorial. fyi, I know it's not an everyday look. Unless you're playing as the Black Swan in Swan Lake.

fCsfQmeEcjc,Catwoman Look,"Tim Burton's Batman has always been one of my favorites! I love the music and the characters. (Yes I am aware Tim Burton didn't create Batman. If you want me to go all history lesson mode on you, Bob Kane created Catwoman, and Frank Miller was the one that made Batman dark (The Dark Knight Returns), which Tim Burton used as inspiration for his movie.

I wanted to recreate Catwoman's look. This look can work with other costumes too, like sexy cop, pirate, etc. Please enjoy this tutorial!

fyi, Batman is my all time favorite comic book character. I remember coming home from school just to catch him on the cartoon series Batman on WB and Toonami. Sigh...those were the days...

I know in the movie, Catwoman's eyes were blue, but I wanted her eyes to be green. It looks more cat like in my opinion. Either way, brown eyes will still look gorgeous with this look =)

rOCzQ3pKGvk,Tim Burton Look,"I remember growing up watching Tim Burton's movies. From Batman to The Nightmare Before Christmas, I feel in love with his hauntingly beautiful characters. I know Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland comes out today, so I wanted to create a look inspired by his romantic, dark vision. Obviously this isn't something you would wear to school or work, (unless you work for Mr. Burton himself). BTW, If you are in NYC, GO GO GO TO THE MOMA to see his Exhibit, it's up there until April I think. AMAZING.  But this look is beautiful without the crazy wig I had on.

poBgTkYsUvI,Lipgloss Saver,"This is a redo of the lipgloss video I made last year. The first version had poor explanation. I was not happy with the older video so I redid it. This trick will show you how to get every last drop of your lipgloss. Every gloss lover should know this trick. People are asking about bacteria, but I've been doing this for years and never saw a problem with it. It's like leaving your lipgloss in the hot car. Make sure the water is not too hot, or else it will warp your lipgloss tubes. If you want to use it for mascara, I would not recommend it (just buy a new tube), but if you must, add a few drops of olive oil in the mascara to get the texture smooth and not so dry again. This also works for Urban Decay Potion Primer. Just put it all in a little container like I did to that lipgloss.  This will also work on nail polish, just make sure to add a few drops of nail polish thinner!

Remember, only remove the rubber stopper and dump the lipgloss in a container when your wand cannot reach the leftover gloss. That way you can use every last drop of your lipgloss. If it's still half full, DO NOT remove the rubber stopper and just use it as is.

9Pobuw7Wk2k,Be A Ninja In 30 Seconds...I Think,"My last Halloween Video for 2009. It was fun everyone!
The title says it all...how to be a ninja in 30 seconds...I think.

Yes, I declare it, I'm proud to embrace my nerdness!

This is for all you last minute folks who don't have a Halloween costume. Instead of going out and buying the leftover costumes on the shelves, just grab your black t-shirt and you got yourself a homemade ninja outfit. My brother taught me this trick when I was 5 years old. Have fun being invisible! 

My occupation is being a Ninja around the graveyard shift.  I would have liked to have showed off my sword...but when I moved I misplaced it in a box :(  I cannot locate my shiny stabby steel =(

2i5qkSxF60U,Sailor Moon Transformation,"WATCH THE WHOLE VIDEO. Special ending. 
Remember Sailor Moon? She was my hero, and she was one of the biggest reason why I loved waking up early to watch her shows on TV right before school. I was inspired to draw Anime after Sailor Moon. Heck, it inspired me to LOVE anime. 

Naoko Takeuchi If you are watching or reading this, thank you so much for creating a hero for all of us girls to look up to.  I dream of meeting you one day. I would probably cry because you are one of my biggest inspiration. Arigato! 

My photo I took with my webcam here
http://xd8.xanga.com/c99f721376532257186781/b204638901.jpg

I love the manga, the artwork and the storyline of Sailor Moon. How she has wonderful friends, her tuxedo mask and an amazing journey to save the world. Every girl can be a super hero now. All you need is an eyeliner and meatball hair.

This is perfect for Halloween, cosplaying any anime character like Chobits, Death Note, Naruto, even Final Fantasy characters like Tifa. If you want a more toned down anime eyes, check out my older one here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJXK5EJEQA

MxXL3j3Qz2M,Painting A Beautiful Heart,"To me, what makes a person beautiful is their heart. I know it sounds cliche, but it's true. People are born young and they grow old. Physical beauty can only last for so long, but what lives on forever is the heart. It may pass on, but the spirit of the heart lives on forever.

I painted this piece using watercolors, makeup and pencil.

The subject is Aerith and Cloud from Final Fantasy VII. One of my Favorite RPG. It was beyond a video game, because you would live in a different reality, every time you turned your PlayStation on.

I use to play with my mother's eyeshadows when I was a child. I applied eyeshadow on my vasaline moisturized lips and realize I created my own blue lip color! It was an amazing discovery for me, but I realize I was not the only one who did this.

I remember someone told me how one of their friends work at Estee Lauder's makeup factory.  The person mentioned how the giant bins they use to mix the eye makeup remover formula had to be replaced often because they corroded and disentegrated the bins. Horrified, I threw away my eye makeup removers and seek for a new option. I found that Extra Virgin Olive Oil not only removed all my makeup, but left my eyes feeling soft, my lashes conditioned and my skin supple. This natural eye makeup remover does not clog the pores or cause milia. Enjoy your inexpensive makeup remover!

Aspirin is made out of salicylic acid also known as Beta Hydroxy Acid, BHA for short.

This is a great spot treatment for a blemish. Please click on the link, there is too much information for me to type on here.

VNA1sp3qRkQ,Everyday Chic School Look,"Ok so I pronounced Lise Watier and Kabuki brush all wrong! I'M HUMAN!!!! I MAKE MISTAKES! LOL anyways, Simple makeup that is natural yet edgy for school. I used afterglow minerals and lise waiter for this look.

When I was in highschool, I was not allowed to wear eyeshadow, foundation etc. I only wore eyeliner. If you are in highschool, you should enjoy your youthful beauty, but if you really feel like you need makeup, but do not want to over do it, this is a great option to try out. It's easy and takes me 3 minutes to do this. it's only longer in the video because I had to do it slower for this tutorial =)

9-x6hCI9X0g,Kitty Litter Facial Mask : Deep Cleansing,"Yep Kitty Litter, but DON'T FREAK OUT! Read or watch the video before you make any assumptions.

This mask is perfect for oily, dirty, large pores skin! If you need to detoxify your skin, this is the best mask to use, and you can make it right at home! Use this once every 2 weeks. You should deep cleanse your face once every 2 weeks to remove impurities.

Detailed entry here
http://www.xanga.com/RiceBunny/689304511/kitty-litter-mask.html

Unscented Kitty Litter is made out of Clay, Bentonite clay to be excat. Bentonite is clay that is is rich in minerals and it comes from volcanic ash. After a Volcano erupts, the ash settles onto the ground, cools down and becomes the clay that we use in many products. This mask detoxifies your skin from impurities and toxins.
This mask is amazing for oily skin and helps to visually improve the look of blemishes, cellulite, sun damage, stretch marks, wrinkles, age spots and reduce the size of pores?

Basically all this means is the clay masks that you use for your facials are really just expensive versions of unscented kitty litter.

Please look past the fact that it's Kitty Litter! In reality, it's all just clay!


I used Publix Brand Kitty Litter

Sorry for the shaky camera, this is the first time I've ever done anything like this. Granted, I got lots of odd stares, but I assured them that I was not bonkers...kind of..

So this On The Go Review takes place at CVS. I figured almost every part of the state has CVS, and you can find most of these products at major drugstores and such. I will be doing a Walgreens, Target, Mac, Sephora and more On The Go Review in the future.
